DONE:
1. I found that there is no relationship for the date columns in dataset because they are not used in predicting the output in the test set
Action: Dropped two columns date and date_block_num

2. Found -ve values in 'item_cnt_day','item_price'
Action: Replaced them to 0 in sales_train.csv

3. After translating Russian to English for the item_categories.csv,  Inferred that the item_category_names are close, hence they can be clubbed together
Action: Rephrase the item categories by grouping the similar categories in item_categories.csv

4. Putting this item_category_id as a foreign key in sales_train.csv could give us some for inferrence.
Action: Add new column item_category_id as a foreign key reference

TODO:
1. Find some avg item sales count by each of 
{Grouped category id, Grouped shop_id} in sales_train.csv

MAYBE IF IT MAKES SENSE:
